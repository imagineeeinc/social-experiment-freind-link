      Social experiment: friend link
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    This social experiment shows that our friends and families are linked together.
    <br><br>
    a list to show:
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>youðŸ‘‡</li>
      <li>are friends with your friendðŸ‘‡</li>
      <li>their cousin are friends withðŸ‘‡</li>
      <li>their friendsðŸ‘‡</li>
      <li>whos uncle is friends withðŸ‘‡</li>
      <li>their friendðŸ‘‡</li>
      <li>who is friends with their friendsðŸ‘‡</li>
      <li>whos nephew is friends withðŸ‘‡</li>
      <li>you</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    But on a more larger scale.
    <br><br>
    The Idea is you have a friend who has a friend or family member that is some how linked to you.
    <br><br><hr><br>
    <div id="whatwithimg">
      <h3>
        What should I do if I get this image?
      </h3>
      If you get this image share it with freinds and family and see after some time will you get the same image back, 
      if you do get the image back that means who ever you shared the image with kept on sharing it untill it came back to you.
